See details here.


# Details #

Android support is now part of the main OpenCV development, at  http://opencv.willowgarage.com/ .
To work with OpenCV on Android, download the pre-built OpenCV library for Android from here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-android/2.3/ .
**Make sure you download the pre-built 2.3.1 package - it is the first link !!**

You need to make sure your Android SDK tools and Eclipse version are updated. More details are available here: http://opencv.itseez.com/trunk/doc/tutorials/introduction/android_binary_package/android_binary_package.html and here: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Android

After downloading, import OpenCV-2.3.1 into Eclipse using File-->Import...-->General-->Existing Project Into Workspace.

In your project's properties, Under Android, add the OpenCV2.3.1 library (press Add.. on the right and select OpenCV2.3.1).

**Good luck!**
