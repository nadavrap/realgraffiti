RealGraffiti is an augmented reality mobile application that lets you paint virtual graffiti on real walls, share it with others and see graffiti painted by other people. Our goals were to create a realistic experience by showing the graffiti as if it was painted on the real wall (without using a marker), and to create a fun and easy to use application.
